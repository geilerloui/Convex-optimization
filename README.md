# Convex Optimiaztion

This material is related to the online course [CVX101 of Stanford]() adapted from the course at the university of Stanford [EE364a: Convex Optimization 1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/). The course following this one is [EE364b - Convex Optimization 2](http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364b/).

For CVX101, Home Work to Stephen Boyd's Convex Optimization class (CVX101 Stanford) with python and `cvxpy`

## Table Of Contents

## CVX101 - EE364a

Concentrates on recognizing and solving convex optimization problems that arise in applications. Convex sets, functions, and optimization problems. Basics of convex analysis. Least-squares, linear and quadratic programs, semidefinite programming, minimax, extremal volume, and other problems. Optimality conditions, duality theory, theorems of alternative, and applications. Interior-point methods. Applications to signal processing, statistics and machine learning, control and mechanical engineering, digital and analog circuit design, and finance.




## EE364b

Continuation of 364A. Subgradient, cutting-plane, and ellipsoid methods. Decentralized convex optimization via primal and dual decomposition. Monotone operators and proximal methods; alternating direction method of multipliers. Exploiting problem structure in implementation. Convex relaxations of hard problems. Global optimization via branch and bound. Robust and stochastic optimization. Applications in areas such as control, circuit design, signal processing, machine learning and communications.
